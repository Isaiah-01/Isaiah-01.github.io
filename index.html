    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a Software Developer and looking to excel my career in software development. In my past job experience I've worked as a Fire Alarm Service Coordinator for TRL Systems. In my 3 years working
        there I was given multiple responsibilites, below are a few.
    <ul>
        <li>Manage a warehouse to make sure inventory variences are kept at a minimum anually.</li>
        <li>Provide competitive pricing to customers to complete projects with while maintaining
            a high profit margin.</li>
        <li>Schedule and manage technicians on projects.</li>
    </ul>
    I ended up leaving TRL Systems as I wanted to shift career paths and attend school for Software Development which led me here.
